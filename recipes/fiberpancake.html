    <h3>Easy High-Fiber Pancakes</h3>
    <p>These high-fiber pancakes are made with chia seeds, ground flax seeds, 
        and bran meal. Top pancakes with butter, maple syrup, or powdered sugar.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ui>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose baking mix</li>
        <li>1/4 cup bran meal</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground flax seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chia seeds</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, or as needed</li>
    </ui>    
    <br>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together milk, eggs, oil, and vanilla together in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk together baking mix, bran meal, sugar, ground flax seeds, chia seeds, 
            and baking powder together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center; add 
            1 tablespoon egg mixture into the well and whisk until well combined. 
            Continue adding and whisking in egg mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, 
            until batter has thickened and takes 1 to 2 seconds to fall off the whisk.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle over medium-high heat; grease with butter.</li> 
        <li>Working in batches, drop 1/3 cup batter onto the griddle about 4 inches apart;
            cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip gently and 
            cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, 
            greasing the griddle with more butter if needed.</li>   
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <p>As pancakes finish, transfer to a baking sheet in the oven to keep warm.
        If storing in the freezer, place pancake-sized sheets of waxed or parchment paper between
        each pancake, then store them in a freezer bag.</p>
